        h2 Intro:
        p Ever since I was very young I have been making games of different sorts. When I was 14 I started using a proper game engine.
        p I still love making games now, especially video games, and I aspire to not only enter the games industry, but to do great things in it.

        h2 About me:
        p I enjoy drawing, sometimes making music, playing games to get all the achievements, taking care of my cats, and certainly making games.
        p All this time I've been making games pretty much solo, but I am so excited to take the next steps and delve into the industry and work in a team who love games as genuinely as I do.
        p For me, it's not just about finishing a game; It's about the process and crafting an experience for others to enjoy.
