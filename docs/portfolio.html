When I was 14 I started using a proper game engine.</p><p>I still love making games now, especially video games, and I aspire to not only enter the games industry, but to do great things in it.</p><br><h4>About me:</h4><p>I enjoy drawing, sometimes making music, playing games to get all the achievements, taking care of my cats, and certainly making games.</p><p>All this time I've been making games pretty much solo, but I am so excited to take the next steps and delve into the industry and work in a team who love games as genuinely as I do.</p><p>For me, it's not just about finishing a game; It's about the process and crafting an experience for others to enjoy.</p><br><h4>Highlights:</h4><p>Minecraft mod with over 1000 downloads</p><p>Made many fully networked multiplayer games</p><p>Skilled with self teaching from a young age</p><p>Uploaded games to itch.io since 2020</p><br><h4>Skills:</h4><p>C#, GDScript, GDSL, Java, Javascript</p><p>Godot, Unreal 5</p><p>Video Game Networking, Git VC</p><p>Game Design, Game Development</p><p>Rapid Learning, Video Editing</p><br><h4>Projects:</h4><p>Deeper Darker (Godot, 2025)</p><p>In my game design class, I was tasked with making a GDD and a simple prototype from it. I had this idea in my head already for a game inspired by one of those co-op first person horror games. I used the Godot game engine and didn’t use any templates or addons as I prefer working off things that I make myself.</p><p>The game would be a roguelike where the player and their friends would venture deeper and deeper into abandoned mines infested with comic horror inspired monsters. The players would go out and gather crystals to bring back to the drill pod to power it, allowing them to go deeper underground. I had to complete the project within the short timeframe I was given.</p><p>I completed the GDD, and started work on the project. My scope wasn’t that small, so by building vertically, I could let myself exit at any point with something still whole. I started with the cave generation. I figured I could make a simple 2D dungeon generator, to then create a bunch of block objects. A ton of meshes everywhere wouldn’t run too great, especially since I was planning to make it run in the browser for ease of playing with others, so I simply combined all blocks into a single render call to the GPU since all the blocks are pretty much the exact same. From there I added multiplayer, before adding in items and the drill pod allowing for the floor to regenerate. With this working, the fun part with the monsters was added to create a complete playing experience. With playtesting with friends, I improved on weaker elements and fixed issues. I sunk a lot of effort because personally I was enjoying this project; I love figuring out how I want systems to work and incorporating them.</p><p>I completed work in May 2025. I was glad I could manage as much as I did in the little amount of time; also the fact I could polish it with nice art, sounds, and other details. I’m also happy that I could make a fully functional multiplayer game that runs in the browser in the time I had, which proves I understand these things well. I managed to impress my class instructor which was pretty nice.</p><p>[WIP - ask for link]</p><br><p>Punch Ball (Godot, 2025)</p><p>I’ve made many local multiplayer games in the past and I enjoy working on those, especially to then play with friends and family. It had been a while since I had made one, and I had a small idea I wanted to make. Quite a bit before then, I had a dream with an interesting game concept, that’s the game I wanted to make, with some modifications. I used the Godot game engine, without any templates or addons, to make this game.</p><p>The game would be a team vs. team sports like game where players control a ball by punching it. The goal is to break the other team's stone tile by hitting the ball into it hard enough enough times by punching the ball. I wanted to complete the project in a short amount of time, and kept the scope low.</p><p>Everything was going nicely and quickly. I made sure to playtest with some friends while making the game and that greatly helped with the gameplay. Early on, if someone was punching the ball which would grow its velocity while the ball is stunned, the best strategy was to push the ball and remove its velocity, which would make the ball stuck in place until one player would stop, this was an oversight. The solution was that punching the ball would make it no longer stunned, effectively letting the player steal the ball, which is fun. Because of the speed I was going at, with consideration, I even expanded scope a little later on to add music which I made in Soundtrap and I added extra polish with particles and other visuals. I realized the mechanics could even do with different game modes, so I added one where players must keep the ball at a certain place for long enough, another which played like lethal league (which was one of the inspirations for the game), and the last one that played like volleyball (this one had to be tweaked a lot because not letting the ball touch the ground at all was overly difficult).</p><p>I completed the project in March 2025 over the course of around two weeks. The project was fun to work on, I love working on little projects every once in a while. I’m glad with this project I have shown to myself I can successfully set a scope low, and be faithful to it, to then expand on it if wanted.</p><p>[WIP - ask for link]</p><br><p>Wizard Cat Proto (GameMaker, 2024)</p><p>For a personal project, I wanted to make some gameplay prototypes. For this one, I wanted a roguelike in which the player would pick up scrolls and create custom spells with them. As I developed, I started getting really into it and added a lot to the game. The spell system works by combining an element, an effect, a shape, and a movement to create a unique spell. With this system, the player can create from a fire ball, to an ice block, to even a healing spell. A full game was never made from this prototype, but it was still a good learning experience and it was also just fun for me. If the game was to be made in full, the prototype helped a lot with figuring out what worked and what didn’t.</p><p>This game allowed me to test game concepts to be able to know what issues those concepts bring so that a proper game can correctly address those. This game features a novel spell casting system that can create a plethora of unique spells. This game was made in 1-2 weeks. Everything was done by myself.</p><p>[WIP - ask for link]</p><br><p>Fjolet Helvete Proto (Godot, 2023)</p><p>There was this game I was envisioning that I wanted to create. I wanted to make a prototype to see if I could manage the technicals. I just wanted to get it to a point where the multiplayer could work on the browser and with it working on mobile. I wanted players to be able to place and colour the world. Most of the game mechanics would be skipped, this was just to see if I could do the stuff I had never done before. It took me a while to make things happen, and I even had to implement mobile UI inputs myself since godot doesn’t have mobile interactions in its high level UI tools. Nearing the end, I cut the fact I wanted some basic combat and rushed a bit since I got the point across that I could do it and wanted to be done with it; the web server stuff was a nightmare for my first time. In the end, I made a cool chat room game with the ability to colour the world.</p><p>Fully networked tile‑placement game with chat; browser & mobile‑friendly. Everything was done by myself.</p><p>Footage link: [WIP - ask for link]</p><br><p>Crank Mansion (Godot, 2023)</p><p>FP roguelite–style prototype: explore a haunted mansion, snag the treasure and escape alive.
