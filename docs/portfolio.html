When I was 14 I started using a proper game engine.</p><p>I still love making games now, especially video games, and I aspire to not only enter the games industry, but to do great things in it.</p><br><h4>About me:</h4><p>I enjoy drawing, sometimes making music, playing games to get all the achievements, taking care of my cats, and certainly making games.</p><p>All this time I've been making games pretty much solo, but I am so excited to take the next steps and delve into the industry and work in a team who love games as genuinely as I do.</p><p>For me, it's not just about finishing a game; It's about the process and crafting an experience for others to enjoy.</p><br><h4>Highlights:</h4><p>Minecraft mod with over 1000 downloads</p><p>Made many fully networked multiplayer games</p><p>Skilled with self teaching from a young age</p><p>Uploaded games to itch.io since 2020</p><br><h4>Skills:</h4><p>C#, GDScript, GDSL, Java, Javascript</p><p>Godot, Unreal 5</p><p>Video Game Networking, Git VC</p><p>Game Design, Game Development</p><p>Rapid Learning, Video Editing</p><br><h4>Projects:</h4><p>Deeper Darker (Godot, 2025)</p><p>- In my game design class, I was tasked with making a GDD and a simple prototype from it. I had this idea in my head already for a game inspired by one of those co-op first person horror games. Once I was done making the GDD in about a week or two, and with a lot of time sunk into it (as I was enjoying working on this one), I managed to make something I am truly proud of. A roguelike where you and your friends venture deeper and deeper into abandoned mines infested with comic horror inspired monsters.</p><p>- The game is fully networked and playable in the browser. It contains cool “dungeon” cave generation and uniquely functioning monsters. Everything was done by myself.</p><p>[LINK HERE]</p><br><p>Punch Ball (Godot, 2025)</p><p>- In the mood to make a small local multiplayer game based on a dream I had a while before, I set out to make a simple game in which the players intended to punch the ball into the opponent team’s stone block to destroy it. Everything was going nicely and quickly. I made sure to playtest with some friends while making the game and that greatly helped with the gameplay. With finishing the game, I added lots of polish, juice, extra game modes, and even some music I made myself to bring it all together. As much as there isn’t much to the game, I only set out to make something small and I managed to nail my goal perfectly.</p><p>- The game features simple and tight controls intended to be played with 4 players, but it works with 2-6 (1 keyboard, 5 controllers). The game is visually stunning and sounds wonderful, especially for the short development time (about 2 weeks). Everything was done by myself.</p><p>[LINK HERE]</p><br><p>Wizard Cat Proto (GameMaker, 2024)</p><p>- For a personal project, I wanted to make some gameplay prototypes. For this one, I wanted a roguelike in which the player would pick up scrolls and create custom spells with them. As I developed, I started getting really into it and added a lot to the game. The spell system works by combining an element, an effect, a shape, and a movement to create a unique spell. With this system, the player can create from a fire ball, to an ice block, to even a healing spell. A full game was never made from this prototype, but it was still a good learning experience and it was also just fun for me. If the game was to be made in full, the prototype helped a lot with figuring out what worked and what didn’t.</p><p>- This game allowed me to test game concepts to be able to know what issues those concepts bring so that a proper game can correctly address those. This game features a novel spell casting system that can create a plethora of unique spells. This game was made in 1-2 weeks. Everything was done by myself.</p><p>[LINK HERE]</p><br><p>Fjolet Helvete Proto (Godot, 2023)</p><p>- There was this game I was envisioning that I wanted to create. I wanted to make a prototype to see if I could manage the technicals. I just wanted to get it to a point where the multiplayer could work on the browser and with it working on mobile. I wanted players to be able to place and colour the world. Most of the game mechanics would be skipped, this was just to see if I could do the stuff I had never done before. It took me a while to make things happen, and I even had to implement mobile UI inputs myself since godot doesn’t have mobile interactions in its high level UI tools. Nearing the end, I cut the fact I wanted some basic combat and rushed a bit since I got the point across that I could do it and wanted to be done with it; the web server stuff was a nightmare for my first time. In the end, I made a cool chat room game with the ability to colour the world.</p><p>Fully networked tile‑placement game with chat; browser & mobile‑friendly. Everything was done by myself.</p><p>Footage link: [LINK HERE]</p><br><p>Crank Mansion (Godot, 2023)</p><p>FP roguelite–style prototype: explore a haunted mansion, snag the treasure and escape alive. Playable for at least an hour. Most art was made by my partner, everything else by me.</p><p>[LINK HERE]</p><br><p>Halloween Grind (GameMaker, 2021)</p><p>Trick or treat multiplayer game to play with friends for an hour. Get more and more upgrades until all have been bought. Only singleplayer version available.
