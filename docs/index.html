I think a silly handmade website stands out way more than a simple linkedin page (I do have one of those too).</p><p>You're already on the github page for the site, but:</p><a href="https://github.com/Naradoxy/hazelWebsite">Here it is anyways.</a><br><br><p>If you want to see the cool stuff,</p><a href="juice">you can go here!</a><br><br><p>That's kind of it!</p></body></html>
