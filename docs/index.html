I always had a passion for creating my own little paper games. Ever since I discovered programming I've loved making video games.</p><p>I love playing indie games that go outside the box and try weird things, and that's the kind of things I like making as well.</p><p>I'd love for nothing more than to be part of a team and be surrounded by experienced devs and to make more than just games, but to make unique and special experiences that speak deeply to the player.</p><p>I've used many game engines (like Godot and Unreal), tools, and programming languages. Most of what I know I've taught myself, and I'm always looking forwards to learn more!</p></div><div class="box"><h2>Links!</h2><a class="bySide" href="cv">CV</a><a class="bySide" href="portfolio">Portfolio</a><p>Feel free to email me through [naradoxy@gmail.com] (fastest professional way of reaching me).</p></div><div class="box"><p>That's kind of it for now!
